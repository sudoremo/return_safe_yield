  # block contains a return. The second block receives the return value of the
  # first block as arguments.

  # The second block is not called if the first one raises an exception.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #   unknown_block = proc do
  #     return
  #   end
  #   ReturnSafeYield.call_then_yield(unknown_block) do
  #     # => This line is called even though the above block contains a `return`.

  #   # => This line here might not be called however as the `return` statement
  #   #    exits the current method context.
  #
  # You can also pass arguments to the first block:
  #
  #   unknown_block = proc do |arg1, arg2|
  #   end
  #
  #   ReturnSafeYield.call_then_yield(unknown_block, 'arg1 value', 'arg2 value') do

  # does not apply if `return` is used explicitely):
  #
  #   unknown_block = proc
  #     'return value'

  # yielding a block in this way never jumps out of your surrounding routine.
  #
  # Note that you cannot pass a block using `safe_yield do`, as it does not make
  # sense to check for `return` statements in code controlled by the caller
  # itself.
